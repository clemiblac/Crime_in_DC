For this project, Joisel was responsible for building the database in MySQL, connect it to AWS cloud using ETL technics. Also, he worked on the development of the Machine Learning algorithm, in collaboration, Joisel developed 6 methods: Support Vector Classifier (SVC), K-nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forest and Neural Network. Joisel have a passion for python and visualizations. 

### Chris Mikus
Chris is a data analyst with a B.Sc. in chemical engineering from the University of Virginia. Chris enjoys developing visualizations that explore trends and correlations that might not be initially apparent. On this site, Chris wrote the programs for the D.C. Crime Map, including layers for ward boundaries, city infrastructure markers, crime report heatmaps, and markers for crime type. He also developed the webscraper to provide recent news updates for D.C. crime reporting.

### Ilana Multak
Ilana is a Data Analyst with a B.A. in Economics from Penn State University. Ilana enjoys telling stories with data, especially about business and healthcare. On this site, she was responsible for data cleaning, data preprocessing, and running various Machine Learning algorithms to determine which best fit our dataset.

### Sarah Schulte
Sarah is a Data Scientist with a B.A. in Psychology from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. She currently holds a certified nursing assistant license as well. Sarah has completed the George Washington University Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp where she learned how to code in Python with a previous held belief that was only a type of snake. For this project, Sarah took on a project management role and worked with the team’s workflow and engagement. She worked with the team to curate visualizations and creative direction for this project. Sarah hopes to grow as a data analyst professionally. She built the ‘Annual Change In Crime by Offense’ graph and ‘Unemployment Rate to Annual Crime Totals’. Sarah hopes to someday work with healthcare data to advocate for better, more informed medical treatment.
